ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a firmware interface that exposes system information like:

    Power states

    Hardware enumeration (similar to device tree)

    Thermal zones

    Embedded controller (EC) access

üìú ACPI Basics
ACPI tables (e.g., RSDP, FADT, DSDT) are located in memory, not I/O ports. You typically access them by:

    Finding the RSDP (Root System Description Pointer)

    Parsing the RSDT/XSDT to find the rest of the tables

    Interpreting AML (ACPI Machine Language) ‚Äî often compiled into bytecode inside the DSDT

üìç Finding the RSDP (BIOS Area)
The RSDP is located either:

    In the EBDA (Extended BIOS Data Area), or

    Between memory addresses 0xE0000‚Äì0xFFFFF

Search 16-byte-aligned addresses for the signature "RSD PTR ".


Assembly Sketch (pseudo-code style):

mov edi, 0xE0000
find_rsdp:
    cmp dword [edi], 'RSD '
    jne next
    cmp dword [edi + 4], ' PTR'
    jne next
    ; RSDP found at [EDI]
    ; Verify checksum
    ; Then parse ACPI tables
next:
    add edi, 16
    cmp edi, 0x100000
    jb find_rsdp


Parsing the tables requires understanding their structure (usually defined in the ACPI Specification).
